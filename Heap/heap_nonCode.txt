Heaps - A complete binary tree that is empty or whose root contains a value >= each of its children and has heaps as its
        subtrees. It is ordered in a weaker sense and it will always be a complete binary tree

        Heapify() - to heapify a non heapify array you must visit every node and compare. O(n)
        Except you can avoid the leafs
