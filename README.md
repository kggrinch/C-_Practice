# C++ Practice Project

## Overview
A practice project folder of my C++ data structures and algorithms learning pilgrimage. The repository contains a collection of specific projects created throughout learning C++
and practicing fundamental data structures and algorithms concepts. The collection contains a variety of projects ranging from basic arrays and sorting algorithms to 
different implementations of graphs, trees, and B-trees with their corresponding functions. Each folder represents a different concept I practiced with implementations built from
scratch to become well versed in the inner workings of common tools used throughout a programmer's career.

## Concepts Covered
* Arrays and Pointers – Basic memory manipulation, pointer arithmetic, and array operations.
* CardClass – Example object-oriented design and encapsulation.
* Conversions – Implementations of numeric and type conversions.
* DataStructures – Core data structure implementations (stacks, queues, lists, etc.).
* Dictionary – Key-value pair storage and lookup functionality.
* GardenProblem – A textbook problem-solving exercise applying garden object functionality.
* Graph – Graph representation and algorithms (e.g., traversal, pathfinding).
* Heap – Min-heap and max-heap implementation with operations.
* List – Singly and doubly linked list implementations.
* ObjectCreation – Practice with object-oriented programming and memory management.
* PassByRefAndLifeTime – Experiments with references, object lifetime, and scope.
* Queue – Queue implementation using arrays and linked lists.
* RecursionPractice – Recursive practice for common problems and patterns.
* TemplateClasses – Practice with C++ templates for generic programming.
* TimeSpanPractice – Implementation of time-related calculations.
* Tree – variaty of tree implementations from generic to binary to balanced, and related algorithms.
* TreeWithTemplate – Generic tree implementation using templates.
* VectorsAndAlgorithms – Practice with STL vectors and algorithm library functions.

## Purpose
This repository is not a clean and fully developed library of concepts but rather a personal practice development sandbox featuring my programming progress. Please understand that
the projects within this repository are still in progress, and I have plans to further expand and learn new techniques and tools throughout my career.
